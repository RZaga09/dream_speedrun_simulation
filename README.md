# dream_speedrun_simulation
Simulation of Ender Pearl and Blaze Rod drop rates in Minecraft compared to Dream's drop rates in his speedruns

50,000 simulations done (can be changed in the code)

For the sake of clarity in the graph, all values are adjusted as if 1000 runs were done per simulation

I did not consider any external factors while making this. Only the probabilities programmed into the game are considered here

Made just for fun
