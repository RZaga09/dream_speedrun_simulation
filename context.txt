Context: Minecraft speedrunner Dream has been accused of cheating in his speedruns due to his unusually high success rate
in gathering "Ender Pearl" items through bartering with Piglin NPCs and in gathering "Blaze Rod" items through killing Blaze enemies

Dream has a success rate of 42/262 ender pearls per barter
Probability of a successful ender pearl barter is 20/423

Dream has a success rate of 211/305 blaze rods per kill
Probability of a successful blaze rod drop is 1/2

This only takes into account the probabilities programmed for the game events to happen
External factors are not considered in this simulation

Expected probability of being successful in both events is 20/846 (approx. 2.364%)
Dream's success rate is 8862/79,910 (approx. 11.090%)
this does not take into account that both events may not have necessarily been attempted in a single speedrun

In Dream's response paper, he included data from 5 other livestreams which are separate from the 6 livestreams initially investigated
Dream recorded 12/356 successful Ender Pearl trades and 73/134 successful Blaze Rod drops
This allows for a combined success rate of 876/47,704 (aprox. 1.836%, which is close to the expected rate)

If we combine the data from all 11 livestreams discussed
Dream's data totals to 54/618 successful Ender Pearl trades and 284/439 successful blaze rod drops
Combined, Dream's success rate is 15,336/271,302
